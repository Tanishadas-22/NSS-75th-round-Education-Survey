NSS 75 th round Education survey
The project aims to analyze key educational indicators for individuals aged 3 to 35 in North Eastern states and across all India using the NSS 75th round education survey data. Specifically, it seeks to assess literacy rates, investigate educational expenditure and its impact on access to quality education, explore drop-out rates and the factors contributing to discontinuance, and examine access to and ability to operate computers and the internet. The findings will help identify barriers to education, inform policy recommendations to enhance enrollment and retention, and develop strategies to improve digital literacy and technology access among young learners.
